\def\AbstractEN{%
\xxx{This thesis is a continuation of my bachelor thesis. In that work, we examined the boundary layer between a star and and the accretion disk. This work led to a single non-linear second-order ODE. In this work, we attempt to examine the equation further. We also include effects of magnetic field into our equations and try to generalise the solution for a general polytropic index. }
